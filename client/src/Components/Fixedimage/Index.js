                                The word perfume derives from the Latin perfumare, 
                                meaning "to smoke through".[3] Perfumery, as the art 
                                of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, 
                                the Indus Valley Civilization and possibly Ancient 
                                China.[4] It was further refined by the Romans and the Muslims.
                                         
                               </p>
                               <p className='p_fixed_image'>
                               The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its
                                sillage, after the French word for "wake", as in the trail left by a boat in water.
