            The word perfume derives from the Latin perfumare, meaning "to smoke
            through".[3] Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in
            ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization and
            possibly Ancient China.[4] It was further refined by the Romans and
            the Muslims.

            The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called
            its sillage, after the French word for "wake", as in the trail left
            by a boat in water.
